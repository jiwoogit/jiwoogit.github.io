## About Me

<div class="about" markdown="1">

I am a Ph.D. student at [Visual Computing Lab](https://sites.google.com/site/vclabskku) at **Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU)**, advised by [Prof. Jae-Pil Heo](https://sites.google.com/site/jaepilheo). I received my M.S. and B.S. degrees from **SKKU**.

My research interests lie in **Generative Models**. Recently, I have been focusing on 3D foundation models and diffusion model acceleration.

Previously, I interned at **NAVER Cloud** (2025.05 - 2025.09), where I conducted research on video diffusion acceleration using cache.
